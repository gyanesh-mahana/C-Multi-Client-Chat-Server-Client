 *	struct thread_info
 *-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Description:
 * Each client connection on the server will consist of two threads; one for
 * reading messages sent by the client, and another for sending messages back
 * to this client which come from another user. The reason for this is so that
 * each client has a dedicated thread for receiving messages from the server.
 * If this method was not implemented, then the other option would be to 
 * iterate through a list of users. The issue with this is if while
 * broadcasting messages to all the clients, if there is a hangup with one
 * client, the clients following the stalled client will also see this delay.
 * Two dedicated threads for each client allow clients to not see the delay
 * posed by issues from other clients.
 *
 * This struct responsibility is to hold the thread id's responsible for 
 * receiving and sending messages to each client. In this sense, the two
 * threads form a client-pair.
 *
 * Parameters:
 * recv_tid		- receiving thread id
 * send_tid		- sending thread id
 *

 * Description:
 * Stores information about new connections.

 * Parameters:
 * username		- The username the user has selected.
 * ip_adress	- The IP address of the user.
 * port			- The port from which the user is connected to.
 * sockfd		- The file-descriptor for the client on the server. 
 * thread_pair	- Points to the thread-pair for the client; receiving and 
 * 				  sending messages.
 * next			- Will point to the next user in a list.
